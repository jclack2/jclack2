# Hi, I’m Justin Clack 👋

**Business Systems Manager / Business Analyst**  
**ERP, EDI, and systems that actually have to work**

---

## About Me

I work at the intersection of **manufacturing operations, ERP systems, and automation**, translating messy real-world business processes into systems that don’t fall over when someone sneezes.

My background spans accounting, ERP implementation, EDI, and internal tooling. I care about **data integrity, process clarity, and reducing human pain through better systems**, not buzzwords.

---

## What I Actually Do

- Design, implement, and improve **ERP workflows** for manufacturing and distribution
- Own and maintain **EDI integrations** (850, 855, 810, 210, 997, AS2, SFTP, third-party VANs)
- Act as the translator between **operations, finance, IT, and vendors**
- Build internal tools, scripts, and glue code to make systems talk to each other
- Debug production issues that everyone else swears “can’t be the system”

---

## Technical Focus

**Languages & Scripting**
- PowerShell (daily driver)
- SQL (analysis, reporting, and “why does this number exist”)
- C# (ERP and integration work)
- Python (automation, utilities, personal projects)

**Systems & Platforms**
- ERP systems (manufacturing-focused)
- EDI platforms and trading partner integrations
- SQL Server
- Git / GitHub
- Windows & Linux environments

**Web & Tooling**
- WordPress (customization, hosting, maintenance)
- React / modern frontend tooling (selectively, not religiously)
- APIs, webhooks, and data pipelines

---

## How I Work

- Strong bias toward **clarity over cleverness**
- Prefer **boring, reliable solutions** that survive handoffs
- Documentation matters because future-me is a hostile coworker
- If something breaks, I want to know *why*, not just how to silence it

---

## What You’ll Find Here

This GitHub contains:
- Utilities and scripts I actually use
- Experiments and proofs of concept
- Notes, templates, and tooling related to ERP, EDI, and automation
- Side projects for learning without pretending they’re startups
